# Vector Space based Document Retrieval system
Completed as an assignment for **CS- F469, Information Retrieval, BITS Pilani, Pilani campus, First Semester 2020**
## Files
This directory contains the following files
* (Sub-directory) `Text_corpus`- contains the text corpus
	* wiki_00, [download link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FtT5XL3WM8u2H_i0LaNvYbgko33E6s1Z/view?usp=sharing).
* (Sub-directory) `Storage`- contains pickle files (.pkl) for generated by index_creation.py 
* (Sub-directory) `Documents`- conatins individual documents generated by index_creation.py
* `index_creation.py`- Primary code file, constructs the vector space based index
* `query_processer.py`- Python file containing functions for query processing
* `test_queries.py`- takes query as input and returns the top 10 retrieved documents
* `WordNetImprovement.py`- conatains the WordNetimprovement class with methods to perform query relaxation (part 2)
* `README.md`
* `requirements.txt`

## Procedure
1. Make sure that files and sub-directories are in order specified above, the subdirectories Documents and Storage are created during runtime. 
2.  All the dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. Make sure that `requirements.txt` is in the directory containing the code files and its your present working directory, execute the following on command line (Windows)
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. After the installation, run the following code in a python interpreter
```python
>>> import nltk
>>> nltk.download('punkt')
>>> nltk.download('wordnet')
```
4. Firstly run the `index_creation.py` in a python IDE, this parses through the text corpus and creates the index along with .pkl files to be used during processing and separate documents based on their doc_id in the parsed corpus.
5. We are now ready to run the `test_queries.py` to retrieve the documents. 
	* Prints the top 10 documents with their scores and title.
	* `open_web` arguement allows user to open the search results in browser window
	* `use_zones` implements Zonal Indexing, suggested as an inprovemnt for ranking and retrieval
	* `enable_query_relaxation` implements query relaxation using WordNet synsets
		* input 1 as arguement for hypernym based relaxation
		* input 2 as arguement for synonym based relaxation

**Note**: Since we are using an multiple data structures to represent the corpus, passing a single location for the inveted index in `test_queries.py`file won't cut it and passing multiple locations is not efficient. Therefore, we have stored and read the required files from their default locations 

All operational deails are commented out or are present as docstrings in the code files. All discussions are present in the assignment report.
